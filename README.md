<h1 align="center">Human Computer Interaction Project Semester 5 - Virtual Contact-less Keyboard</h1>
<h3>During the pandemic one of the important precaution to take was to avoid physical contact. But it is not always possible to avoid physical contact especially when it comes to using of devices like computers in cyber cafe, so unfortunately they have to be closed down.
So a system has been developed to use this virtual keyboard which could be used without coming in contact with the surface of device.</h3>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Programming Language - Python
</li>
<li>OpenCV as a real-time computer vision library
</li>
<li>PyAutoGUI library is used to click, drag, scroll, move, and to click at an exact position.</li>
<li>Imutils is used to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV
</li>
</ul>
